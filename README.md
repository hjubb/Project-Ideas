# Project-Ideas
This repository is designed to brainstorm all the crafty ideas into one central location

If you have ideas on Open Source projects for this group, please do share your idea by making a new text file (.md) in this repository:

Format your idea like so:

Project Name: The name of the project

Required Technologies: What languages will this most likely be coded in/OS

Project Description: The description of the project itself

If enough people want to take up on your idea, then you can brainstorm the idea more and start making your sprint backlogs, etc.
